FIWARE IoT Stack allows you to connect devices and receive data, integrating all 
device protocols and connectivity methods, understanding and interpreting relevant information. 
It isolates data processing and application service layers from the device and network complexity, 
in terms of access, security and network protocols.

These are the main benefits of solutions 'powered by the FIWARE IoT Stack':

- Simple sensor data integration 
- Device-independent APIs for quick app development & lock-in prevention
- Modular
- Scalable. High available
- Open & standards based. FIWARE compliant

## APIs available 

FIWARE IoT Stack provides the following APIs:

- [Authentication API](authentication_api.md): manages tokens for APIs usage.
- [Device API](device_api.md): allows managing devices, sending data from the device to the cloud and receiving commands.
- [Data API](data_api.md): allows querying and subscribing to data stored at the cloud.
- [Historic Data API](historicdata_api.md): allows querying historic data series and statistics stored at the cloud.
- [Data Processing API](dataprocessing_api.md): allows analyzing data stored at the cloud on real time and triggering actions.
- [Management API](management_api.md): allows creating new services, subservices, users and roles. 

## Management Portal 

FIWARE IoT Stack provides also a website for performing most of the FIWARE IoT Stack management operations available on APIs. These are the most relevant actions you can perform:

- Creating new services and subservices
- Creating new users 
- Creating new devices
- Visualize stored data
- Send commands to devices
- Set up simple notifications based on data. 

## FIWARE Components

FIWARE IoT Stack is based on the following FIWARE components in order to provide its functionality:

- Device Backend Gateway (IDAS)
- Context Broker (Orion)
- Short Term Historic (STH)
- Connector Framework (Cygnus)
- Complex Event Processing (Perseo)
- Identity Management (IDM)
